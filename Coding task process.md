# Working on task

    > Step 0. Had to fix my local npm first, which was pointing me continuously to a private npm registry ::)

    > Building on top of basic Vue3 project setup, not trying to clean up everything atm to save time

    > Create a default button
        + loading custom font `Inter`
        + std, hover, active, disabled states
        + loading state

    ToDo's:
    > crossbrowser testing
    > responsiveness testing
    > optimise base.css resets  
    > use LESS\SASS
    > a button with icon
    > a button as icon only
    > a button with badge
    > a button with icon and badge
    > icon only + badge
    > a button with loading icon
    > a button with a dropdown
    > ghost buttons styling
    > medium buttons styling
    > small buttons styling
    > remove extra comments, console logs, clean up code
    > storybook 
    > component tests
